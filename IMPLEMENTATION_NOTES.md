- OJ Subtotal: 70 points
- Code Review (20%): TBD
- Estimated Total: 70-90 points

## Technical Implementation
- Language: C++ 17
- Build: CMake + Make
- Data structures: STL containers (map, vector, set)
- File I/O: Binary file storage with custom FileStorage class
- Tokenizer: Custom implementation supporting quoted strings
- Validation: Comprehensive checks for all input types

## Known Limitations
- Performance on very large datasets (1775 TLE)
  - Current approach: Load all, modify, save all
  - Would need: Indexed file structure (B+ tree) for production scale
